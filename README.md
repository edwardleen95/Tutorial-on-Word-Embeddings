# Word Embeddings Tutorial: From Theory to Practice

## About This Tutorial

This repository contains a comprehensive tutorial on word embeddings, covering three fundamental techniques: Word2Vec, GloVe, and FastText. The tutorial includes theoretical explanations, practical implementations, and comparison of these methods.
- Detailed conceptual explanations
- Architectural diagrams
- Performance comparisons
- Ready-to-run code examples

## Repository Contents

### 1. Theory Documentation
- **Word Embeddings.docx** - Complete guide containing:
  - NLP fundamentals and embedding concepts
  - Architectural diagrams (CBOW, Skip-Gram)
  - Comparative analysis of techniques
  - Practical use cases (Sentiment Analysis, Machine Translation)
  - When to use each embedding type

2. **Jupyter Notebooks** (to be added)  
   - Practical code implementations for:
     - Training Word2Vec models
     - Loading and using pre-trained GloVe embeddings
     - Implementing FastText with subword information
     - Sentiment analysis application
