# Word Embeddings Tutorial: From Theory to Practice

## üìñ About This Tutorial

This repository contains a comprehensive tutorial on word embeddings, covering three fundamental techniques: Word2Vec, GloVe, and FastText. The tutorial includes theoretical explanations, practical implementations, and comparison of these methods.
- Detailed conceptual explanations
- Architectural diagrams
- Performance comparisons
- Ready-to-run code examples
